Now the new problem is that when I create a new file it appears on my screen, but doesn't appear for connected users. But it does show up after a refresh, and it is also updated on the db correctly.

Second problem is when I create a new folder, it appears only my screen and doesn't appear for other connected users. But this time it doesn't appear after a refresh even for me. Also I check and it is not updated in the DB
